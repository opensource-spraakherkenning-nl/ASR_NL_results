<h1>Dutch ASR Performance</h1>

Welcome to the page where researchers and developers report performance of various ASR models on Dutch datasets.

<h2>UT's Kaldi_NL vs. Whisper vs. XLS-R evaluation</h2>

*UT = University of Twente*

- [Results for N-Best 2008 Dutch Evaluation corpus](./UT/N-Best/nbest_res.md)
- [Results for Jasmin-CGN corpus](./UT/Jasmin/jasmin.md)
- [Hardware setup & model configurations](./UT/hardware.md)
- [Why do the results differ between whisper-timestamped and faster-whisper?](./UT/analysis.md)

The results in **bold** indicate the best performance for the specific subset(s) between all models.

<h2>RU's Kaldi_NL vs. Whisper vs. Wav2vec2.0 evaluation</h2>

*RU = Radboud University*

- [Results on four medical domain datasets](./RU/wer.md)
- [Hardware setup](./RU/hardware.md)


These results were achieved during the PDI-SSH Homo Medicinalis ([HoMed](https://homed.ruhosting.nl/)) project (2021-2024).
